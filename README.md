## 🚀 Currently Building: SteamServerUI

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteamServerUI/SteamServerUI/main/media/v6.png" alt="SteamServerUI Interface" width="400" align="right">

What started as a tool to tame Stationeers dedicated servers has evolved into **the ultimate Steam game server management platform**. Because why should server management be harder than the games themselves?

**The Evolution:**
- 🎮 **v5 (StationeersUI)**: Rock-solid LTS for space engineers
- 🌟 **v6 (SteamServerUI)**: Universal Steam server overlord in development

**What it does:**
- 🔄 Zero-config SteamCMD automation
- 🎯 One-click server control with retro-styled web UI
- 🤖 Discord bot integration for remote management
- 💾 Smart backup systems that actually work
- 🔒 Secure by default (JWT auth, TLS)
- 🛠️ Universal game support via JSON runfiles

From **Satisfactory** to **Project Zomboid**, **Valheim** to **Counter-Strike 2** – if SteamCMD can download it, SteamServerUI can manage it.
