# About Me
I've been floundering around in Go for more than a year now, and while I‚Äôm still not sure how I‚Äôm doing it, I actually get shit done now! And I‚Äôm still having a blast pretending I do! Maybe I will even release a ***** NOT YET ***** at some point. Its in development since 06/2023. If you're curious about my adventures, check out my website and my journey page. 

A heads-up: Don't even think about contacting me about SAP or Shitrix. Life‚Äôs just too short.
